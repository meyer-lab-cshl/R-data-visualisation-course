# Introduction
In the previous tutorials, you have learned how to visualise your data, from
simple scatter plots with default settings to compound figures with elaborate
color schemes and labels. For all of these, we used the data from [@Smith2004]
(made available at the following
[http://www.antigenic-cartography.org/](link)). I mentioned briefly in the
previous exercises, that I had formated the data for us to work with.
What I expressed there in a half-sentence, usually contains a lot of work, often
more than the actual analysis: cleaning your data, bringing it into the 
right format, checking it for sanity. In the following sections, we will
learn how to use `dplyr` to reformat data into a 'tidy' format that we can use
for visualisation and analysis.

For a more detailed description and additional examples, refer to chapter 5
in Hadley Wickham book 'R for Data Science' [@Wickham2017]. I would generally
highly recommend this book, as it introduces concepts we have discussed in this
course and beyond - its online version is available for free
[here](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)!

In addition, for an overview and help on `dplyr` functions take a look at the
`dplyr` cheat sheet accessible by choosing *Help* > *Cheatsheets* >
*Data Transformation with `dplyr`* in the RStudio tool bar.  

# Set-up 
First, we are going to set up our analysis script,
```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      comment = "#>",
                      collapse = TRUE,
                      fig.width = 6,
                      fig.align = "center",
                      fig.pos = 'h',
                      out.width = "70%")
```

load the required libraries
```{r libraries, message=FALSE}
library("readr")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
library("forcats")
```

and read our dataset into R again:
```{r paths}
coord <- read_csv("data/2004_Science_Smith_data.csv")
```

# dplyr: a grammar of data manipulation
The `dplyr` package is a core member of the tidyverse. Its main functionality
relies on six functions that let us solve the majority of data reformating.
These functions, often described as the `verbs for the language of data
manipulation', are:

* `arrange()`: to change the order of observations;
* `select()`: to select a subset of variables;
* `mutate()`: to add new variables that are functions of existing variables;
* `filter()`:  to subset observations based on their values;
* `summarise()`: to summarise observations to a single row;
* `group_by()`: to change the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to
individual groups.

All verbs work in a similar fashion:

* their first argument is a `tibble` or `data.frame`;
* the following arguments describe the action to apply to that 
  `tibble`/`data.frame` by specifying the variable names
* the result is a new `tibble`/`data.frame`, dependent on the initial input

**Note**: If you want to save the results of a `dplyr` function, you have to use
the assignment operator `<-`, as `dplyr` functions never modify their input
data.

## Change the order of observations with `arrange()`
Using `arrange()`, we can change the order of rows. As input, `arrange` takes
a `tibble` and a set of variable names - at least one is required. It will 
re-arrange the observations of the `tibble` based on variable selected for
re-ordering. 
If you provided more than one variable to order the tibble by, each additional
variable will be used to break ties in the values of preceding variables.

<div class="row" style="padding: 25px 50px 75px 50px">
  <center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="arrange()", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-arrange.png")
```
  </center>
</div>

**Note**: These visualisations for `dplyr` verb function are inspired by the
`dplyr` cheat sheet.

Here, we are going to order `coord` by location and year:
```{r}
arrange(coord, location, year)
```

As a default, `arrange` orders the variables in ascending order. To re-order in
descending order use `desc()`:
```{r}
arrange(coord, desc(location), year)
```
### Exercises
1. How does the ouput change if you sorted by year first, then location?
2. Sort `coord` to find when the last virus was isolated.
3. Find the largest and smallest x.coordinate in the dataset.

## Select a subset of variables with `select()`
`select()` let's us pick a subset of variables. In the most simple case,
we specify the `tibble` from which we want to `select()` variables, followed
by the names of the variables that we want to pick.

<div class="row" style="padding: 25px 50px 75px 50px">
  <center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="select()", out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-select.png")
```
  </center>
</div>

 For instance, we could
select only name and location:
```{r}
select(coord, name, location)
```

To exclude a variable, use `select()` with the variable name preceded by a 
minus `-`:

```{r}
select(coord, -type)
```

In addition to that, there a  number of functions that can be used in
conjunction with `select()` that let us select multiple variables with common
elements in their name. These include:
    
* `starts_with("year")`: matches names that begin with “year”.
* `ends_with("coordinate")`: matches names that end with “coordinate”.
* `contains("coord")`: matches names that contain “coord”.
* `num_range("X", 1:3)`: matches X1, X2 and X3.
* `everything()`: matches everything that has not specifically been named
  before (see Exercises to mutate for example).

### Exercises
1. What are two other ways of only selecting the `x.coordinate` and
`y.coordinate` columns?
2. Can you use `select` to move the `location` variable from second column to
last?

## Add new variables with `mutate()`
To add new variables to a `tibble`, we use `mutate`. Again, `mutate` first
expects the name of the `tibble` to which we want to add a variable, followed
by the name of the new variable, an equal sign `=` and the data to add. The 
data has to have the same number of observations as our input `tibble` and
can be created by using a transformation of an existing variable.

<div class="row" style="padding: 25px 50px 75px 50px">
  <center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mutate()", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-mutate.png")
```
  </center>
</div>

Here we create a new variable, that contains the Euclidean distance of each
antigen from the origin at (0,0):
```{r}
mutate(coord, distance=sqrt(x.coordinate^2 + y.coordinate^2))
```

**Note**: `mutate()` adds the column at the end of the `tibble`; if you want it
at a different position use `select` to reorder the variables afterwards.

### Exercises
1. Add a new column that contains the time difference between this year, 2020,
and the year the virus was isolated.
2. Save the result of this `mutate` in a new object.
3. Move the new column between the `year` and `cluster` columns.


## Select of subset of observations with `filter()`
`select` creates a subset of the input data by selecting
variables. `filter()` allows us to subset our input data by observations.
As a first argument it takes the name of the `tibble`; this
is followed by expressions that filter observations based on their value in the
specified variables. Filtering uses the standard set of comparison operators 
available in R.

<div class="row" style="padding: 25px 50px 75px 50px">
  <center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="filter()", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-filter.png")
```
  </center>
</div>

### Comparisons
Comparison operators in R:

* `==`: equal to
* `!=`: not equal to
* `>`: greater than
* `>=`: greater or equal than
* `<`: less than
* `<=`: less or equal than

**Note**: When testing for equality, make sure to use `==` and not a simple `=`!

For instance, the following code let's us select all observations of viruses
in circulation before 1988:
```{r}
filter(coord, year < 1988)
```

In addition to these comparison operators, we can also use boolean operators to
filter the input data. The simplest boolean operator is intrinsic to the 
`filter` function: multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with *and*,
i.e. every expression has to be true for an observation to be kept in the
output.
For instance, all observations of viruses in circulation before 1988 in
BILTHOVEN.
```{r}
filter(coord, year < 1988, location == "BILTHOVEN")
```

Any more complicated combinations, like in circulation before 1988 but not in
BILTHOVEN and not in MADRID, can be constructed using the logical operators *and*
`&`, *or* `|` and *not* `!`. The graphic below shows a complete overview of
selection logical subsets of observations for two variables "red" and "blue":

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap="Boolean Operators", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/operators.jpg")
```


Using these logical operators, we can filter for viruses in circulation before
1988 but only in BILTHOVEN or in MADRID:

```{r}
filter(coord, year < 1988, location == "BILTHOVEN" | location == "MADRID")
```
Alternatively, we can solve the above using the `x %in% y` syntax:
```{r}
filter(coord, year < 1988, location %in% c("BILTHOVEN", "MADRID"))
```
where we select every row where `x`, in this case location, is contained
in `y`, here a vector of names.

**Note**: vectors are R data objects and are constructed by enclosing the
variables`x`, `y`, `z` to be put in the vector in `c()`: `c(x,y,z)`

### Exercises
1. Find viruses whose isolation is specified as NETHERLANDS.
2. Filter for rows that are of type antigen (AG). 
3. Find viruses in circulation after 1997 and are assigned to either cluster
SY97 or cluster WU95.

## Group analyses and summarise observations with `group_by` and `summarise()`
`group_by` and `summarise()` often go hand in hand: using `group_by`, we can
first group observation based on values in the specified variable and then
apply a summary statistic on this group. This might sound a bit complicated,
so let's have a look at an example. We are fist going to group `coord` by
cluster. To pass this grouped `tibble` onto the `summarise` function, we
have to save the grouped `tibble` into a new object (for now, we will see
further down how we can do this more elegantly). We pass this new object to 
`summarise`, to find the start and end year of circulation for viruses per
cluster. 

<div class="row" style="padding: 25px 50px 75px 50px">
<div class="col-lg-6">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:groupby-caption)", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-group_by.png")
```
</div>

<div class="col-lg-6">
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="summarise()", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dplyr-summarise.png")
```
</div>
</div>



(ref:groupby-caption) group_by().

To find the start and end year, we can use the R functions `min` and
`max`, that find the minimum and maximum entry of a `tibble` column or vector, 
respectively:

```{r}
coord_grouped <- group_by(coord, cluster)
summarise(coord_grouped,
          start=min(year),
          end=max(year))   
```
Functions used with `summarise` have to return a single value. Other useful 
functions are for instance:

* `mean`: returns mean value;
* `median`: returns median values;
* `sum`: return the sum of input values;
* `n()`: returns total count (this is the only one that does not take an
argument);
* `n_distinct`: returns the unique count;

### Exercises
1. How do you know if a `tibble` is grouped or not? How do you ungroup a grouped
`tibble` (Hint: use the help function of `group_by`).
2. What happens if you use the same `summarise` command on the original,
ungrouped `tibble`?
2. Find the mean x and y coordinate of each cluster.
3. Find the total and distinct number of locations per cluster.

# Creating a workflow with pipes
We have seen above how useful it is to first use `group_by` and then `summarise` 
on the grouped `tibble`. However, we had to first save the grouped `tibble` in
a new object, that we passed on to summarise. This object solely served the
purpose of an intermediate step in our workflow. To avoid having to create
intermediate objects, we can use the pipe function `%>%`. To do the same
grouping and summarising as above, we can now simply write:

```{r}
coord %>% 
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    summarise(start=min(year), end=max(year))   
```

where we pipe `coord` into the grouping function, and then pipe the output 
of that into the summarise function.

This is really powerful and elegant, when we have to apply many processing steps
to our data and want to avoid having to create lot's of intermediate objects.

For instance, in this chunk, we apply grouping by cluster, then summarise start,
end and number of locations and then sort in ascending order by start year.
We save the entire process in a new object by using the `<-` operator.  

```{r}
circulation_summary <- coord %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    summarise(start=min(year),
              end=max(year),
              location=n_distinct(location)) %>%
    arrange(start) 
```

We can then visualise the cluster transition over time in a segment plot. We
additionally map the number of distinct locations to the size aesthetic, to
visualise the its spread.

```{r, fig.height=5}
circulation_summary <- coord %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    summarise(start=min(year),
              end=max(year),
              location=n_distinct(location)) %>%
    arrange(start)

p <- ggplot(circulation_summary)
p + geom_segment(aes(x=start, xend=end, y=cluster, yend=cluster,
                     size=location, color=cluster)) +
    scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
    labs(x="Year",
         y="Antigenic cluster",
         size="Distinct locations",
         color="Cluster") +
    theme_bw()
```
This plot does not yield the result we expected. Despite us having arranged
the `tibble` by start year, this is not the order it was plotted. This is 
something very confusing to beginners and even more experienced R users 
stumble over this from time to time. When using a character column (here cluster
names) as aes, `ggplot` treats it as a factor column (we mentioned factors
as a representation of categorical variables with fixed possible values in part
2 of this course).
By converting characters to factors, the values are internally ordered
alphabetically, which in this case disrupts the ordering we desired. 

To prevent this, we can explictly convert the cluster column into a factor and 
enforce the original order by the `fct_inorder` function. We can chain this
processing onto our previous workflow using a pipe and the `mutate` function.

The segment plot with the ordered factor as y-labels looks as we expect:
```{r, fig.height=5}
circulation_summary <- coord %>%
    group_by(cluster) %>%
    summarise(start=min(year),
              end=max(year),
              location=n_distinct(location)) %>%
    arrange(start) %>%
    mutate(cluster=fct_inorder(cluster))

p <- ggplot(circulation_summary)
p + geom_segment(aes(x=start, xend=end, y=cluster, yend=cluster,
                     size=location, color=cluster)) +
    scale_color_brewer(type="qual", palette = "Set3") +
    labs(x="Year",
         y="Antigenic cluster",
         size="Distinct locations",
         color="Cluster") +
    theme_bw()
```

## Exercises
1. Create a piped workflow that finds the number of distinct clusters and the
first virus isolation for each location.
