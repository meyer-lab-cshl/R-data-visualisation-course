# Welcome!
Welcome to the R course: Introduction to Data Visualization in R!
The following document contains a checklist of things to do **before** the
course starts. They are a requirement to participate in the course - if
you run into any issues with the installation, let us know! 

# Install R and R studio desktop 

If you use a Mac and use `brew` for managing your software, please do:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
brew install r
brew install --cask rstudio
```

If you are on a different operating system or you do not use `brew`, please go
to this website to download and install R: https://cran.rstudio.com/.
Choose the download link that matches your operating system (mac, windows,
linux) and follow the instructions.

Then, go to this website to download and install R studio - desktop version:
https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/.
Choose the download link that matches your operating system (mac, windows,
linux) and follow the instructions.

Once you installed both R and R studio desktop (in that order!), open 
R studio. 

In the default set up, you will see four panels (see figure below):

    * upper left: a text editor (where I am currently writing this text)
    * lower left: your R terminal
    * upper right: panel showing you an empty environment
    * lower right: panel showing you files, plots, etc.
 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/R-studio-screenshot.png", dpi=250)
``` 
We will talk about the function of all of these panels at the beginning of
the course. For now, you just need to identify the R terminal i.e. the lower
left panel. We will use this panel to install a  number of libraries that we
will need during the course.

# Install libraries
Libraries or packages are a collection of functions, data and documentation
for a specific task, for instance plotting or simulation.
However, the initial R install only comes with a very basic set of
libraries. Any additional packages that we want to use have to be installed 
first.

Copy the following lines into your R terminal (lower left panel) and press
enter. You should see a lot of text being printed to the terminal, while R
installs these packages.

**Note**: If prompted to select if packages should be compiled from source,
please enter 'no'.

```{r install libraries, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("forcats")
install.packages("cowplot")
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("rnaturalearth")
install.packages("RColorBrewer")
install.packages("rgeos")
```

# Test your installation
In the following section, we will test if the installation of the packages
was successful. Do not worry if you do not understand the following commands
yet, we will discuss them during the course. For now, we just want to make sure
we can get started with the right set up on the day of the course.

Please copy the following lines into your terminal and hit enter:
```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library("tidyverse")
library("forcats")
library("cowplot")
library("sf")
library("rnaturalearth")
library("RColorBrewer")

world <- ne_countries(scale = "medium", returnclass = "sf")
left <- ggplot() + geom_sf(data = world)

nc <- sf::st_read(system.file("shape/nc.shp", package = "sf"), quiet = TRUE)
right <- ggplot(nc) + geom_sf(aes(fill = AREA))
```

Please copy these two lines now. If everything worked out, you should see the
following output in your plots window (lower right) and terminal (lower left) 
```{r test}
plot_grid(left, right)

head(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal.info)
```

Please make sure that you see the same output as above. If you run into
problems, please reach out and we can try and help set it up before the class.
We expect everyone to come with all requirements installed and will not help
with the setup during class, so please be prepared and ask in advance!
